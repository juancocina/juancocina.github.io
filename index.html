            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p class ="lead">
              I am a Computer Science Graduand from California State University, Fullerton. <br><br>
              I found my attraction to CS having grown up with video games, consoles, and computers. Having spent time outside of school, my current goal is to merge my passion
              for audio with my desire to code. <br> I don't where this path will take me, but I know I'm not afraid to fail.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I believe one of my strengths is musical creativity; its what I love. My current challenge is looking for projects that allow me to express that part of myself.
              I recently developed a Random MIDI Singal Generator using the JUCE Framework. I took some time, but I got it done. That was probably the most interesting coding project
              I've ever done, including school projects. I want more of that. I know my coding skills are not the sharpest, but I believe my persistence and willingness to try make up 
              for that (in my opinion).
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Usually, I prefer Visual Studio or VSCode for any coding in HTML, CSS, JS, and C++. When I work with Python, I found that I prefer PyCharm.
            <p class="lead">
              My personal goals remain the same; invest time in myself and my projects. My professional goals have changed, however. I would like the opportunity to work on
              VST Plugins, DAWs, or standalone audio projects. As well as try to make a horror game, or music for a horror game. I think that would be fun.

                  Adobe XD makes it easy to put an idea together fairly quickly, and even allows you to export them as HTML.<br>
                  Here I learned not too hold onto ideas too tightly. As projects grow and evolve, things can change, and you have to adapt. 
                  Even though the design I made wasn't used, I'm happier with the look of the final product.

                  Simple Python script I made to remind myself every hour, at the 45 minute mark, to stand up and stretch.
                  Using AppleScript inside of the python file, it sends notifications to my mac desktop, along with a shell script that 
                  is automated to run the python script on boot. Any future iteration would include removing the spinning cog wheel at the top of the menu bar,
                  as seen in the screenshot.
                  <br><br> The windows version is something similar, it sends a notification to my desktop, but it uses a batch file alongside 
                  Windows Task Scheduler, to run the script on boot.

                <p> This is my current ongoing personal project. <br><br>
                  I came up with the idea of a web app that would help me be more organized with my day. The back end currently works with HUG API to
                  create end points, SQLite for a database, and a few python libraries to assist. The idea here was to add "tasks" to a database. 
                  The database would be scanned once when I boot my pc and use the <a href="https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"> schedule</a> 
                  library to create jobs for the python script to do. The job itself will call pythonsms.py, which would then send a text to my phone, reminding
                  me to start on a new task. <br><br>
                  This is still a work in progress that I hope to complete before the end of summer.

                <p>This was a simple quick sin wave generator I created using the JUCE framework, 
                  following a few of their tutorials. The framework (and this project) is based around C++. Their Projucer 
                  makes it really easy to work with XCode (and other IDEs) to get everything running properly.
                  This was pretty fun and intuitive, but now I have an idea for a sequencer that I might start soon...<br><br>
                  As you can see in the screenshot, there is a volume, frequency, and duration bar which you can
                   move to hear a specific sound.

                <p>As part of my ongoing effort to learn React.js, I found a wonderful tutorial published by The Net Ninja on youtube.
                  It covers useStates, fetching, hooks, onClick events, and more. <br><br>
                  I also learned about JSON Server, which can hold JSON Data in a file, and serve enpoints to your front end.
                  Here you can make GET, POST, and DELETE calls that are later reflected on your site. I figure this is very
                  good for testing, but not so much for a public site. <br>

                <p>
                  Simple C++ project made to mimic the Behringer TD-3's RAND button, but in text form. On the TD-3 synthesizer, clearing a pattern and then 
                  pressing the RAND button will generate a random pattern of musical notes with a random set of NOTES, TIES, or RESTS (within a two octave range). 
                  It really creates some weird and cool noises. I wanted to do this for myself. I thought it would lend to creative ideas and send some sparks flying.
                  It did. <br><br>
                  Since I get to input the notes into my DAW or straight back into the TD-3, I get more freedom of going, "Oh this sounds good, but it would sound better if...".
                  I can play around with it more. <br><br> The code won't be uploaded onto github until I finish the next project...
