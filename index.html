            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p class ="lead">
              I am a Senior status Computer Science student enrolled at California State University Fullerton. <br><br>
              I found my attraction to CS having grown up with video games, hand helds, consoles, and computers. By the time
              I step foot on a college campus, I already knew that I wanted to be in the realm of computers and programming.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I believe one of my strengths is creativity, which is why I have chosen to go more into web development. Front-end shall
              be my focus, but I want to expand into back-end development in the future.
              So far, I've mainly worked with bare HTML/CSS/JS, and Bootstrap templates, but I've picked it up fairly quickly.
              Later down in this page, you can see some of the work I've done, along some of the projects I've worked on.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Usually, I work in an Ubuntu Virtual Machine when it comes to anything to do with HTML, with my text editor of choice being Atom.
              For Windows, I usually use Visual Studio 2017, but have more recently enjoyed using VSCode, and Notepad++ for smaller things.
            <p class="lead">
              Right now my main personal goal is to get more experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as work with other developers.
              Some career goals would be to land an internship, land a website commission, and to get my Bachelor's Degree.

                A project from my algorithms class to find the Magic Balloon Juice. <br>
                Most of this project is in JavaScript, and was actually my first experience dealing with classes and objects in JS.

                This was an algorithms project I worked on with a friend that goes to UC Davis. Our task was to create a grid with a bot that would move from cell to cell, changing colors
                as it went on. It was challenging for me as I had not worked with JavaScript or HMTL at the time, so I was mainly shadowing for this assignment. That being said,
                it did spark my curiosity, and it's what made me want to pursue front end development.
